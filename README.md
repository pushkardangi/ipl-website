# IPL Website
Website created as project in 10th Grade

Back then I only knew HTML — no CSS, no JavaScript, not even the faintest idea of what they were supposed to do. Still, building this little IPL website in 10th grade felt like stepping into a new world. Every page was crafted with curiosity, and every mistake turned into laughter while working on it with my best friend. It wasn’t polished, but it was ours, and it sparked the love for creating things on the web.
