It had always been Lalit Modi�s dream to launch a domestic cricket league in India�one with citybased
teams akin to football and basketball franchises in the United States. And in December 2007 he
was poised to finalize plans for such a venture�The Indian Premier League (IPL). With $25 million
in seed money from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to recruit players, he still faced
much risk and uncertainty. Would Indians enjoy a fast-paced, three-hour version of a game whose
current short form took all day? Would they root for teams based in various Indian cities instead of
for a national team? Would the BCCI and other important cricket boards around the world buy in to
this new format?
<par>
The BCCI gave him his recruitment money on the condition that he run the league out of his personal
Mumbai office, earn no salary, and pay all personal costs incurred in pursuing IPL interests. Modi, in
turn, agreed, with the stipulation that the BCCI would not interfere with the operations of the IPL for
the first five years and would defer to his judgment in the selection of the IPL Board of Governors.
Thus, Modi�s task, as he neared the realization of his dream, was to create the right set of incentives
to motivate players, broadcasters, franchise owners, and the various cricket boards to support the
IPL. What kinds of deals should he strike to guarantee long-term commitment without conceding too
much of the earnings he expected the league to generate? And what should he do to ensure that the
IPL would become a permanent part of the Indian sports landscape?
The first IPL tournament was set to be played in April; he had four months to get it all right.
